## Results ##

#### Stage conditions ####

#### Stateless conditions ####

The AI fast learning away from invalids actions within 1 minute ( learning time randoms )

#### Randoms play ####

#### Street Fighters ####

Gym Retro games had actions space or sample but you can create agentQueue for the same purpose. ( The games introduced background layers problems will discuss them later )

#### Mario Bros ####

Mario Bros is a more simple problem for solving but it is equipped by equation expression with stage time elapsed problems.
